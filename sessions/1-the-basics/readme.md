# Session Overview

This session is intended to provide you with a basic introduction to React. The intent here is to provide you with a set of tests that you need to get to pass.

Below are commands that you will need to know to verify the tests work and how to view your code running in a browser.

## Getting Started

First you will need to install the dependencies required to run tests and run the site using a dev server:

```bash
# Installs all dependencies for running tests and the site
yarn install
# Or
npm install
```

### Running Tests

```bash
yarn test
# Or
npm test
```

### Running the Site

```bash
yarn start
# or
npm start
```
